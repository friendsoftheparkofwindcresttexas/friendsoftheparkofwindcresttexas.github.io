### Basura Cleanup

A great day when we'll help clean our local waters

## Scott Gorton:

8 am check in, 9 - noon clean up.

I believe if we set Takas Park as a meeting point we can plan on doing:

- Rosillo Creek from Windrock to Montgomery through Autumn Sunset and Brook Falls lakes

- Beitel Creek branch from Winn property line through Takas Park past Public Works

- Walzem Creek from Golf course/Midcrown past Windway to Windsor Hill

     ... yes, all of our creekways drain into Salado

- Possibly also the other Beitel Creek branch along Crestwind if we are good for help.
 

#### Here's a small record of what we and other community volunteers accomplished.
