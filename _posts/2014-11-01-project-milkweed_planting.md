### FOTP planting gardens for monarch butterflies, April 2015

Windcrest Friends of the Park partnered with the City of Windcrest to provide a total of three Pollinator Gardens. These will serve as feeding stations for both migratory and local butterflies, hummingbirds, and bees to help with the declining pollinator population. These insects and birds directly or indirectly affect between 50 and 70 percent of the food we eat.

In addition, these gardens will provide color in a natural setting for our local parks. They will also serve as viewing center for local students and teachers.

Monarch butterflies have declined to 10% of their previous population and are due to become an endangered species. They need all the help we can give.

FOTP got help from Tom Garcia and his crew (Windcrest Public Works) with a nice effort in trimming/mowing, both here and earlier this week at the Windy Hollow Island. A super effort from our Windcrest Friends of the Park work team.

Following photos are of the planting near Takas Park on April 4, 2015.

Yes, really, it was a cold day in Texas in April.

A real nice looking result but nothing compared to one or two months from now. Wait and see!
