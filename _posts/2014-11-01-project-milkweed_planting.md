### FOTP planting gardens for monarch butterflies, April 2015

   Windcrest Friends of the Park partnered with the City of Windcrest to provide a total of three Pollinator Gardens to serve as feeding stations for both migratory and local butterflies, hummingbirds, and bees in an effort to help with the declining Pollinator population. These insects and birds directly or indirectly affect between 50 and 70 percent of the food we eat. These Gardens will also serve as viewing center for local school students and teachers.

   These centers will serve as a way station for both monarch butterflies, which have declined to 10% of their previous population and are due to become an endangered species and other insects both local and migratory. In addition these gardens will provide color in a natural setting for our local parks. The job is done and done well.  

   Help from Tom Garcia and crew (Windcrest Public Works) with a nice effort in trimming/mowing, both here and earlier this week at the Windy Hollow Island. A super effort from our Windcrest Friends of the Park work team.

Yes, really, it was a cold day in Texas in April.

All done! Can't wait to come back in a few months for another photo.

A real nice looking result but nothing compared to one or two months from now.

Wait and see!
