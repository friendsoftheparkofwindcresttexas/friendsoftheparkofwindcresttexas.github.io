### Planting milkweed gardens

Monarch butterflies coming up from Mexico pass through and around Windcrest. This year we're going to help them by planting some of their favorite flowers: butterfly bush, lantana, plumbago, esperanza, milkweed later on, and more. 

FOTP will be planting gardens like this all around town in coming months and years.

Next two photos are of the planting near Takas Park on April 4, 2015.

Yes, really, it was a cold day in Texas in April.

All done! Can't wait to come back in a few months for another photo.
